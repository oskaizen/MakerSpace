# 🧠 Reasoning Model Answer
### Question:
How does inflation affect interest rates and the broader market?

### Model Used:
`gpt-4.1` (Reasoning-tuned)

### Response:
Example 1:
{
  "possible_explanation": "Wage catch-up/indexation",
  "mechanism": "Cost-of-living adjustments or strong bargaining raise nominal pay alongside prices.",
  "impact_on_wages": "Real wages stay roughly flat; nominal wages rise with inflation.",
  "time_frame": "Short to medium run",
  "economic_context": "Inflation with indexed contracts, tight labor markets, or robust unions."
}

Example 2:
{
  "possible_explanation": "Real wage squeeze",
  "mechanism": "Prices rise faster than nominal pay due to weak indexation or delayed bargaining.",
  "impact_on_wages": "Real wages fall, eroding purchasing power.",
  "time_frame": "Immediate to near term",
  "economic_context": "High or accelerating inflation with slack labor markets or rigid pay-setting."
}
